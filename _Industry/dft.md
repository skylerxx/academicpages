This study presents a comprehensive analysis of travel patterns in the UK, with a focus on optimizing transport services through data-driven insights. Drawing on the National Travel Survey and mobile phone data, we examine commute behavior, transport preferences, and economic factors that influence travelling decisions. The methodology integrates descriptive statistics, spatial analysis, and regression modeling. This study underscores the car as the predominant mode of UK travel, with notable exceptions in London where income influences transport choices. Disparities in regional connectivity suggest a need for targeted infrastructure enhancements. Findings highlight the importance of considering economic factors and age demographics in policy-making. Additionally, the complex relationship between connectivity and satisfaction for walkers and cyclists indicates a potential area for improving safety and environmental conditions. These insights are pivotal for policymakers to refine transport strategies and ensure equitable and efficient mobility across the UK.
