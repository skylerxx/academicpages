### Abstract

This paper develops a structural approach to forecasting GDP through volatility by linking aggregate output volatility to the evolving interactions of sectoral activity. The approach decomposes volatility into an idiosyncratic component and a synchronisation component and then uses these to adjust the weight placed on high-frequency indicators in mixed-frequency GDP nowcasts. Incorporating these volatility dynamics into standard nowcasting models tempers forecasts overshooting and improves their reliability during episodes of economic turbulence.
