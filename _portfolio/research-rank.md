### Abstract

Abstract: This paper delves into the spectrum of performance-based ranking systems in competitive organizations. Existing literature has primarily concentrated on the implications of top-tier or bottom-tier rankings, while the simultaneous interplay among the broader population at other ranks has been largely ignored. We apply the network approach and econometrics to reveal the complexities of rank transitions and their associated effects on performance. Our analysis highlights a clustering of rank changes within multiple quantiles in the group; it also indicates that transitions in rank typically take place between adjacent positions. Challenging the established 'tournament theory' in economics, our findings reveal that overall rank stability is crucial for enhancing group performance. We also observe that individual performance improves when the rank immediately above is stable but declines with stability in the neighbouring lower rank. These findings offer novel perspectives on the role of rank dynamics in collective success, emphasizing the importance of systemic stability and neighbourly interactions.
