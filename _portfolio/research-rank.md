### Abstract

This paper delves into the spectrum of performance-based ranking systems in competitive organizations. Existing literature has primarily concentrated on the implications of top-tier or bottom-tier rankings, while the interplay among the broader population at others ranks has been largely ignored. We apply a network approach with econometrics to reveal the complexities of rank transitions and their associated effects on performance. Our analysis highlights a clustering of rank changes within the top and middle tiers; it also indicates that transitions in rank typically take place between adjacent positions. Challenging the established 'tournament theory' in economics, our findings reveal that overall rank stability is crucial for enhancing group performance. We also find that individual performance improves when the rank immediately above is stable, but decreases with volatility in the ranks below. These findings offer novel perspectives on the role of rank dynamics in organizational success, emphasizing the importance of stability and neighborly interactions.
