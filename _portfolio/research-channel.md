### Abstract

This study explores how business-to-business e-commerce channels diffuse through industrial sales networks. Drawing on the time-series transactional data from sales professionals, we conceptualise adoption as a sequential and dyadic process linking salesperson and customer behaviour. Salespeople initially adopt the channel as a general productivity tool, then engage in targeted propagation within their customer portfolios, triggering a localised diffusion mechanism in which customer uptake depends on relational exposure and adaptive complementarities. This multi-level dynamic reveals that digital transformation in industrial selling is not a simple matter of individual acceptance, but an interactive process of mutual adaptation.
