### Abstract


Low-performing employees, the laggards of a team, are often looked down upon and receive little credit from their organizations compared to high-achieving employees. In this study, we focus on the role of laggards in an organizational context and shed light on their contributions to the team performance. Drawing on organization theory and behavioral strategy literature, we theorize that the improvement of a laggard’s performance nudges the whole team to achieve higher performance because the laggard’s coworkers experience “last-place aversion”. 

We test this proposition using panel data from an industrial trading company spanning 8 years with over 3,300 interactions between laggards and their teams. We identify our effects using fixed-effects estimators and lagged dependent variable regressions, together with an instrumental variable approach and control function methods. Results confirm that a laggard’s performance affects the performance of the remaining team. This effect is stronger when the laggard’s performance is similar with the performance of other team members. These results contribute to organization and strategy research by identifying the impact of individual-level behaviors on organizational capabilities.
