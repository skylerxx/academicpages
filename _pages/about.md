I'm a doctoral researcher with a focus on quantitative economics at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I currently hold a visiting PhD position at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

I'm also trained at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), after I completed my study at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focuses on quantitative economics, which combines economic theory with econometrics and machine learning to study economic incentives, resource allocation efficiency, and economic growth and volatility. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in modelling dynamic changes, causal inference, and complex network with longitudinal data, especially for modern economic data with high-dimension observations.

I initiated [Quantitative Solution Network](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/phdlife/phdnetworks/quantitativesolutions) in 2021, with funding support from Warwick Doctoral College. This event series bring together PhD students from different subject backgrounds, to share their own experiences, challenges and insights in applying advanced quantitative methods and econometric theory in their research. 

Since 2022, I worked with both public sectors (e.g. [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport)), FTSE-listed companies (e.g. [Johnson Matthey PLC](https://matthey.com/)), and financial services sector (e.g. [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en-uk/research-reports/)) to develop quantitative strategies and apply novel machine learning methods to investigate their empirical challenges. In 2021, I took on the role as the Head of the Nudge Unit at the [Warwick Behaviour Insights Team (WBIT)](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/priorities/behaviour-brain-society/research/wbit/). 

I currently serve as a science team advisor at The Alan Turing Institute, driving the development of multidisciplinary data science and AI initiatives, identifying industry challenges, and overseeing key research reports and publications.

Beyond my daily routine, I play tennis and go horse riding.
