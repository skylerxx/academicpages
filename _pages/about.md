I'm a doctoral researcher with a focus on quantitative economics at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I currently hold a visiting PhD position at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

My research is also trained at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), after I completed my study at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My PhD focuses on quantitative economics, which combines economic theory with econometrics and machine learning to study competition dynamics, resource allocation efficiency, and strategic decision-making processes. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in modelling dynamic changes (e.g. multivariate time series, discontinuous growth), causal inference (e.g. fixed effects, instrumental variables and difference-in-difference), and complex network with longitudinal data, especially for modern macroeconomics data with high-dimension and high-frequency observations.

I recently initiated [Quantitative Solution Network](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/phdlife/phdnetworks/quantitativesolutions), with funding support from Warwick Doctoral College. This event series will bring together PhD students from different subject backgrounds, to share their own experiences, challenges and insights in applying advanced quantitative methods and econometric theory in their research. The event will run both online and face-to-face. If you are interested in participating or in giving a presentation, please feel free to get in touch with me or [Doctoral College](mailto:doctoralcollege@warwick.ac.uk). 

From 2022 to 2023, I was the member of the Data Study Group at The Alan Turing Institute, collaborating with both public sectors (e.g. [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport)) and FTSE-listed companies (e.g. [Johnson Matthey PLC](https://matthey.com/)) to develop quantitative strategies and apply novel machine learning methods to investigate their empirical challenges. In 2021, I took on the role as the Head of the Nudge Unit at the [Warwick Behaviour Insights Team (WBIT)](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/priorities/behaviour-brain-society/research/wbit/). 

Outside of my work, I play tennis.
