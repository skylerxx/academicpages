I'm a PhD candidate at [Warwick Business School](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/), University of Warwick, UK. I completed my study at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focuses on economic modelling and behavioural science. This combines microeconomic theory with econometrics and machine learning to study productivity, mobility and sustainable development at both the individual and the collective level. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in modelling the dynamic change (e.g. discontinuous growth) and causal inference (e.g. fixed effects, instrumental variables and difference-in-difference) with longitudinal data, esepcially for modern data sets with high-dimension and high-frequency observations.

I recently initiated [Quantitative Solutions & Networking Series](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/phdlife/phdnetworks/quantitativesolutions) with Carlo Hofer, with the funding support from Warwick Doctoral College. This event series will bring together PhD students from different subject backgrounds, to share their own experiences, challenges and insights in applying advanced quantitative methods and econometric thoery in their research. The event will run both online and face-to-face. If you are interested in participating or in giving a presentation, please feel free to get in touch with me or [Doctoral College](mailto:doctoralcollege@warwick.ac.uk). 

In December 2022, I joined the Data Study Group at [The Alan Turing Insutitue](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), collaborating with the [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) to investiagte people's travelling behavours across the UK. In 2021, I took on the role as the Head of the Nudge Unit at the [Warwick Behaviour Insights Team (WBIT)](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/priorities/behaviour-brain-society/research/wbit/). We are engaged in collaborative research by applying insights from behavioural science and social psychology to create nudges for local businesses and communities as well as individual wellbeing.

Outside my research, I play tennis.
