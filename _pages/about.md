I'm a doctoral researcher in the [Finance and Economics program](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/finance-and-economics) at The Alan Turing Institute, where my project focuses on panel data modelling and machine learning in economics and behavioral science. Starting in October 2023, I'll also be joining [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/research-centres/) as a visiting PhD fellow.

My PhD is also trained at [Warwick Business School](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/), University of Warwick, after I completed my study at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My reserach combines microeconomic theory with econometrics and machine learning to study productivity, mobility and sustainable development at both the individual and the collective level. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in modelling dynamic change (e.g. discontinuous growth) and causal inference (e.g. fixed effects, instrumental variables and difference-in-difference) with longitudinal data, especially for modern data sets with high-dimension and high-frequency observations.

I recently initiated [Quantitative Solutions & Networking Series](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/phdlife/phdnetworks/quantitativesolutions), with funding support from Warwick Doctoral College. This event series will bring together PhD students from different subject backgrounds, to share their own experiences, challenges and insights in applying advanced quantitative methods and econometric theory in their research. The event will run both online and face-to-face. If you are interested in participating or in giving a presentation, please feel free to get in touch with me or [Doctoral College](mailto:doctoralcollege@warwick.ac.uk). 

In December 2022, I joined the Data Study Group at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), collaborating with the [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) to investigate people's travelling behaviour across the UK. In 2021, I took on the role as the Head of the Nudge Unit at the [Warwick Behaviour Insights Team (WBIT)](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/priorities/behaviour-brain-society/research/wbit/). We are engaged in collaborative research by applying insights from behavioural science and social psychology to create nudges for local businesses and communities as well as individual well-being.

Outside my research, I play tennis.
